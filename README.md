# Cheap-Finance-Tools
I don't want to pay for a Bloomberg Terminal.

Simply put, I'm a long-time excel user who loves data and finance. 
I decided to learn Python as excel and Google Sheets just weren't cutting it.
So, here I am today. Relatively new to coding and wanting to automate data collection wherever possible.

My current projects are:
  - Total Exchange Volume (published)
  - Historically Mapping GDP/CPI QUAD Model (published, working on adequately graphing)
  - Charting Stocks with Non-Moving Monkey Averages (90% Python Coded, Stable Work in Google Sheets)
  - Building GDP Tracker (5% Python Coded, Stable Work in Progress in Google Sheets)

I'm always open to feedback!
